With impressive graphics, smooth controls, and minimal bugs, it's hard to believe that this game was only created in an impressive 24 hours. Popular YouTuber brothers Sketch and Bandi created Fish Game with hopes to give players a fully working and honest experience, unlike similar games under the same title that constantly crashed or weren't even finished.",
