        "text": "I'm not big on fast food, so I was unaware of Grimace Shake's celebrity status until now. Originally, this was an easy-going purple creature that loved to play with young milkshakes and cheeseburger fans. But in this twisted version, Grimace Shake is a ruthless killer that chases players across the map. That sounds weird and fun, so I wanted to ensure I'm fully covered with some Grimace Shake codes, just in case things go south. Most Roblox codes will give you bonuses to get more health or better weapons. Some Grimace Shake codes will give you a speed boost to escape the monster, while others may reward you with excellent cosmetics. If you like scary games, try Roblox DOORS Codes to help you have even more fun while running away from monsters!",
